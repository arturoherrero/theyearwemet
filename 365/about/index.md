Hiya!

We’re Arturo Herrero and Irene Alegre and we believe practice makes perfect.

We love learning new things and experimenting, and get a kick out of working on
projects and creating something beautiful.

We have decided to start a 365 project, posting one photo a day during an
entire year. Irene has been doing some amateur photography for seven years,
focusing mostly on portrait and street photography, whereas Arturo has been
considering photography for a while and is now finally ready to take the
plunge!

Our aim is to produce a record of our year, a collection of colours, shapes and
personalities that will help us remember what we went through, what we did or
who we did it with. But, more than anything else, we want to use this blog as
an outlet for our creativity, a way in which to work on our photography skills
while we have fun and forge a collective memory.

You’ll find Arturo’s photos on the left and Irene’s on the right, but hopefully
our styles will be different enough that you will be able to recognize our
work.

> Arturo uses:
>
> - Canon EOS 700D
> - Basic but reliable Canon EF-S 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6 IS STM
> - Joby GorillaPod SLR-Zoom Tripod for SLR cameras

> Irene uses:
>
> - Old, road-tested Canon 50D
> - EF-S 17-85mm f/4-5.6 IS USM
> - The very fun 50mm f/1.8 STM
> - Remote control
> - Sony NEX-3N (surprisingly decent hybrid)

Thanks for passing by, and we hope you will enjoy our photography adventure as
much as we do.
